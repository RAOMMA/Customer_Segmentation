# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This Python project focuses on segmenting customers using K-Means clustering, a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm. The goal is to group customers based on their purchasing behavior, allowing businesses to tailor marketing strategies and services to different customer segments.

## Dataset

- **Dataset Name**: [Mall_Customers]
- **Data Source**: [upload on git]
- The dataset contains the following attributes:
  - [CustomerID,Gender,Age,Annual Income (k$),Spending Score (1-100)]

## Project Structure

- **README.md**: Documentation of the project.
- **customer_segmentation.py**: Python script for performing customer segmentation using K-Means clustering.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Customer-Segmentation-using-K-Means-Clustering

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended) and install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate

## Clustering Analysis
This project utilizes the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. It explores different aspects such as customer spending patterns, helping businesses understand and target specific customer groups.

## Results
The project provides insights into distinct customer segments, allowing businesses to make data-driven decisions for personalized marketing strategies.

## Future Improvements
There are several ways to enhance the customer segmentation analysis:

-Experiment with different numbers of clusters (K) to find the optimal number.

-Explore additional features or data sources for more accurate segmentation.

-Implement other clustering algorithms for comparison.
